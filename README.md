# VBA_challenge

This project was to run though a list of stock information for an entire year for various tickers.

The analysis was to capture various data such as:

The yearly change for each ticker's stock price. This was color coded, green for stocks that increased and red for those that fell.
The percentage change over the year in stock price
The total stock volume over the year per ticker

Then I found the stock that had the greatest increase in stock price that year
I found the stock that had the lowest decrease in stock price that year
I found the stock that had the greatest volume for that year

All this analysis was done for 3 separate years. One tab for 2018, Another for 2019 and a third for 2020
